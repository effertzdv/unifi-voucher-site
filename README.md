# FORKED from main project!

Changes so far:

## Batch filtering
Similar to the UNIFI hotspot portal the note ("name") is displayed and can be filtered by

![Vouchers Overview - Desktop](.docs/images/batch_view.png)

## PDF output with multiple vouchers on a single page
Added PDF output for a multiple vouchers on multiple A4 pages

![batch printed PDF](.docs/images/pdf_batchprint.png)

## Minor adjustements
- the expired status was never shown
- multi-use / single-use didn't work correct for vouchers with a limited number of uses. E.g. 4x uses allowed was display as single-use voucher
- add a variable sitename. This name is added to the header (if defined) - helps to distinguish multiple sites

## Prerequisites

- UniFi Network Controller (Cloud Key, Dream Machine, or Controller software)
- UniFi Access Point (AP)
- UniFi Local Account with 'Full Management' access

[Follow this guide to set up the Hotspot Portal](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000166827-UniFi-Hotspot-Portal-and-Guest-WiFi), then continue with the installation below

> Ensure voucher authentication is enabled within the Hotspot Portal

> Attention!: We recommend only using Local UniFi accounts due to short token lengths provided by UniFi Cloud Accounts. Also, UniFi Cloud Accounts using 2FA are not supported!

> Note: When creating a Local UniFi account ensure you give 'Full Management' access rights to the Network controller. The 'Hotspot Role' won't give access to the API and therefore the application will throw errors.

## Installation

### Docker

You can easily run UniFi Voucher Site using Docker. We provide two release tracks to ensure you have flexibility in how you manage your deployments:

- **Master Branch**: The `latest` Docker tag is always built from the `master` branch. This tag contains the most recent changes, but may also include experimental or less stable features.
- **Tag-based Versions**: For production environments, we recommend using tag-based versions. These tags correspond to specific, stable releases of the application. To use a tag-based version, simply replace `latest` with the desired version number.

**Below is an example docker-compose.yml file that can help you get started:**

## Services

The project consists of two main services: Web and API.

### Web Service

The Web service is a user interface accessible through a web browser. It provides functionality for generating, viewing,
and managing vouchers within the UniFi system.

### API Service

The API service allows programmatic access to voucher-related functionalities. It is designed for developers who wish to
integrate voucher management into their applications or automate voucher generation processes. Below are the details of
the different endpoints available in the API:

#### Endpoints

  }
}
```

> This endpoint is protected by a security mechanism. To access it, users need to include a bearer token in the
request authorization header. The token must match the value of the `AUTH_INTERNAL_BEARER_TOKEN` environment variable. Without
this token, access to the endpoint will be denied.

## Authentication

The UniFi Voucher Site provides three options for authenticating access to the web service.

> Note that these options only affect the web service; the API service uses a different authentication method, which is explained above.

### 1. Internal Authentication (Default)

By default, the UniFi Voucher Site uses an internal authentication method. You can set the password for this internal authentication using the `AUTH_INTERNAL_PASSWORD` environment variable.

```env
AUTH_INTERNAL_PASSWORD: '0000'
```

> To enable/disable internal authentication use the `AUTH_INTERNAL_ENABLED` environment variable

### 2. OpenID Connect (OIDC) Authentication

The UniFi Voucher Site allows seamless integration with OpenID Connect (OIDC), enabling users to authenticate through their preferred identity provider (IdP). Configuration is easy using environment variables to align with your existing OIDC provider.

#### Configuration

To enable OIDC authentication, set the following environment variables in your application’s environment:

- **`AUTH_OIDC_ENABLED`**:
  Toggle to enable/disable OIDC authentication. Set this value to `true` to enable OIDC authentication. (Default: `false`)

- **`AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER_BASE_URL`**:
  The base URL of your OIDC provider. This is typically the URL where the well-known OIDC configuration is hosted (e.g., `https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`).

- **`AUTH_OIDC_APP_BASE_URL`**:
  The base URL of your UniFi Voucher Site application. This should be the public URL where the site is accessible to users (e.g., `https://voucher.example.com`).

- **`AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`**:
  The client ID registered with your OIDC provider. This value is specific to the OIDC client created for the UniFi Voucher Site.

- **`AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`**:
  The client secret associated with your OIDC provider. This value is specific to the OIDC client created for the UniFi Voucher Site.

> Ensure your idP supports **Confidential Clients** with the **Authorization Code Flow**

#### Determine Supported Client Types

To identify which client types your OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider supports, you can check the `.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint. This endpoint contains metadata about the OIDC provider, including the supported flows and grant types.

1. **Access the `.well-known/openid-configuration` URL:**

   The URL is typically structured like this:
   ```text
   https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
   ```

2. **Look for the `grant_types_supported` Field:**

   In the returned JSON, the `grant_types_supported` field will indicate the flows your provider supports: Check if your response contains `authorization_code`.

   Example snippet:
   ```json
   {
     "grant_types_supported": [
       "authorization_code",
       "implicit",
       "refresh_token",
       "client_credentials"
     ]
   }
   ```

#### OIDC IdP Integration Guides

This section provides integration guides for configuring the UniFi Voucher Site with various OIDC (OpenID Connect) Identity Providers (IdPs). These guides cover the necessary steps for setting up the IdP, configuring client credentials, and integrating the IdP with the UniFi Voucher Site.

Below is a list of tested Identity Providers (IdPs) with detailed integration instructions:

- [Keycloak](.docs/oidc/keycloak/README.md)
- [Authentik](.docs/oidc/authentik/README.md)
- [UniFi Identity Enterprise (UID)](.docs/oidc/uid/README.md)
- [ZITADEL](.docs/oidc/zitadel/README.md)

> Integrated with an IdP that is not on the list? Feel free to create a guide for others and contribute it to the project

### 3. Disabling Authentication

If you prefer not to use any authentication for the web and api service, you can disable it entirely by setting the `AUTH_DISABLE` environment variable.

```env
AUTH_DISABLE: 'true'
```

> Note: This disables the token based authentication on the API

## Print Functionality

The UniFi Voucher Site application includes built-in support for printing vouchers using 80mm receipt printers, offering a convenient way to distribute vouchers in physical format.

### Compatibility

The print functionality is compatible with most 80mm thermal receipt printers commonly used in various industries. These printers typically use thermal printing technology, eliminating the need for ink cartridges and ensuring efficient and cost-effective voucher printing.

### Configuration

To enable the print feature, you need to set the following environment variables:

```env
PRINTER_TYPE: ''
PRINTER_IP: ''
```

Here’s what each variable represents:

- **`PRINTER_TYPE`**: Sets the printer type used by UniFi Voucher Site. Supported options:
    - `pdf`: For generating PDF files formatted for 80mm paper width.
    - `escpos`: For printing directly to network-enabled ESC/POS compatible printers.

- **`PRINTER_IP`**: Specifies the IP address of the network-enabled ESC/POS printer. This variable is only required when `PRINTER_TYPE` is set to `escpos`.

### Usage

#### PDF

If you're using the PDF option, once your 80mm receipt printer is configured and connected to your local client, you can easily export vouchers to pdf from the UniFi Voucher Site application. Simply navigate to the voucher within the interface and click on the "Print" button.

The application will automatically format the voucher for 80mm paper width, ensuring optimal printing results. Depending on your printer settings and preferences, you may adjust print quality, paper type, and other printing parameters to suit your needs.

##### Example PDF

![Example PDF](.docs/images/pdf_example.png)

#### ESC/POS

For network-enabled ESC/POS compatible printers, set the `PRINTER_TYPE` to `escpos` and provide the printer's IP address in the `PRINTER_IP` variable. Once configured, you can print vouchers directly to your network printer from the UniFi Voucher Site application.

Just like with PDF printing, navigate to the voucher and click on the "Print" button. The application will send the print job directly to the ESC/POS printer over the network, ensuring quick and seamless voucher printing. Make sure your printer supports ESC/POS commands and is correctly configured to accept print jobs over the network.

##### Tested Printers

- EPSON TM-T88V
- EPSON TM-T20X
- EPSON TM-T82IIIL
- Posman BTP-R880NP
- NetumScan NT-8360 / 80-V

##### Example Print

![Example Print](.docs/images/escpos_example.jpg)

## Email Functionality

The UniFi Voucher Site includes a convenient email feature that allows you to send vouchers directly to users from the web interface. By configuring the SMTP settings, you can enable email sending and make it easy to distribute vouchers digitally.

### Configuration

To enable the email feature, you need to set the following environment variables with your SMTP server details:

```env
SMTP_FROM: ''
SMTP_HOST: ''
SMTP_PORT: ''
SMTP_SECURE: ''
SMTP_USERNAME: ''
SMTP_PASSWORD: ''
```

Here’s what each variable represents:

- **`SMTP_FROM`**: The sender email address that will appear in the "From" field when users receive the voucher.
- **`SMTP_HOST`**: The hostname or IP address of your SMTP server (e.g., `smtp.example.com`).
- **`SMTP_PORT`**: The port used by your SMTP server (e.g., `587` for TLS or `465` for SSL).
- **`SMTP_SECURE`**: Set to `true` if your SMTP server requires a secure connection (SSL/TLS), or `false` if it does not.
- **`SMTP_USERNAME`**: The username for authenticating with your SMTP server.
- **`SMTP_PASSWORD`**: The password for authenticating with your SMTP server.

These settings allow the application to connect to your SMTP server and send emails on your behalf.

### Usage

Once the SMTP environment variables are configured, the email feature will be available within the UniFi Voucher Site interface. After generating a voucher, you will see an option to send the voucher via email. Enter the recipient's email address, and the application will send the voucher details directly to their inbox.

## Release Notes

Detailed information on the changes in each release can be found on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/glenndehaan/unifi-voucher-site/releases) page. It is highly recommended to review the release notes before updating or deploying a new version, especially if you are upgrading from a previous version.

## Migration Guide

### Migration from 3.x to 4.x

When upgrading from 3.x to 4.x, the following changes need to be made:

1. **OIDC Public Flow Removal**
    - The OIDC public flow has been removed in v4. Only the **confidential flow** is now supported.
    - Users must migrate to the confidential flow. Updated integration guides are available to help with this migration: [OIDC IdP Integration Guides](#oidc-idp-integration-guides).

2. **OIDC Endpoints Update**
    - OIDC endpoints have been moved to dedicated paths.
    - Update the IdP callback URL from **`/callback`** to **`/oidc/callback`** in your IdP configuration.

3. **Environment Variable Changes**
    - **`AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_TYPE`** has been **removed**. It is no longer required.
    - **`AUTH_OIDC_ENABLED`** has been introduced. If you are using OIDC, you must set `AUTH_OIDC_ENABLED` to **`true`** in your environment configuration.
    - **`AUTH_INTERNAL_ENABLED`** has been introduced.
        - If you are using **internal authentication**, set `AUTH_INTERNAL_ENABLED` to **`true`**.
        - If you are using OIDC **and want to disable internal authentication**, set `AUTH_INTERNAL_ENABLED` to **`false`**.

4. **Password Variable Rename**
    - **`AUTH_PASSWORD`** has been renamed to **`AUTH_INTERNAL_PASSWORD`**.
    - Update your environment variable to use `AUTH_INTERNAL_PASSWORD` if you rely on internal authentication.

5. **Bearer Token Variable Rename**
    - **`AUTH_TOKEN`** has been replaced by **`AUTH_INTERNAL_BEARER_TOKEN`**.
    - Update your environment variable to use `AUTH_INTERNAL_BEARER_TOKEN` for api bearer token authentication.

### Migration from 2.x to 3.x

When upgrading from 2.x to 3.x, the following changes need to be made:

1. **`SECURITY_CODE`** has been replaced by **`AUTH_PASSWORD`**.
    - Update your environment variables configuration to use `AUTH_PASSWORD` instead of `SECURITY_CODE`.

2. **`DISABLE_AUTH`** has been replaced by **`AUTH_DISABLE`**.
    - Replace `DISABLE_AUTH` with `AUTH_DISABLE` in your environment variables.

3. The API bearer token now uses a dedicated variable **`AUTH_TOKEN`**.
    - Ensure that your API token is now stored under the `AUTH_TOKEN` variable and update your implementations to use this new token instead of the `SECURITY_CODE`.

### Migration from 1.x to 2.x

No migration steps are required.

### Migration from Versions Prior to v1

Versions before v1 do not have a direct migration path. If you are using a version earlier than v1, a fresh installation is required. Be sure to back up any important data before proceeding with a re-install.
